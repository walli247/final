			<h1>Diet</h1>
			<p class="desc">Wolves eat large, hooved animals like deer, elk, moose, and caribou.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>Population</h1>
			<p class="desc">There are about 3,700 grey wolves in the great lakes area.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>Habitat and Range</h1>
			<p class="desc">Grey wolves used to be found throughout the United States, but were almost brought to elimination by the mid 1930’s. Today, they can only be found in Canada, Alaska, the Great Lakes area, the northern Rockies, and the pacific northwest.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>Behavior</h1>
			<p class="desc">Wolves live and hunt in packs of 7-8 wolves. Packs include the mother and father wolves (the aplhas), their pups and older offspring. The alpha male and female make the major decisons in the pack and are the leaders. 
			Wolves communicate through whines, howls, and growls. Although they don’t actually howl at the moon. They are more active at dawn and dusk.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>Reproduction</h1>
			<p class="desc">Wolves breed once a year between January and March. Wolf pups are born blind and defenseless, and the pack cares for them until they are 10 months ols when they can take care of themselves. Once grown, wolves may leave the pack. They might go up to 500 miles.</p>
